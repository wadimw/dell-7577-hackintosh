Dell Inspiron 7577 Gaming
CPU: i5-7300HQ (Kaby Lake), iGPU: HD 630, dGPU: GTX 1060 Max-Q, Screen: Full HD, Disk: M2 SATA SSD Crucial MX500, Lenovo Broadcomm BCM94352Z, 8GB RAM DDR4

I'l recreate whole config in preparation for Catalina hoping that now I'll know what I'm doing.

I will try to keep it as Vanilla as possible.
